# Paste Onto New Tab Button Revived

This add-on allows you to paste an URL or search from your clipboard (or primary selection, see below) by middle-clicking the new tab button (just like it’s possible in Chrome/Chromium).

Did you know that you do not have to explicitly copy text when you are using a Linux-based operating system (which uses [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11)) like [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) or [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)? It is enough to select the text, and you can paste it by clicking the middle mouse button (or scroll wheel). Just try it after installing this extension: Would you like to know, what a “wampum” is? Just select the word by double clicking it, and then middle-click on the new tab button.

By the way, if you are a Linux user and you are missing this auto scroll thing when middle-clicking on a webpage, which is enabled by default in Firefox for other operating systems, go to [about:config](about:config) and change the value of `general.autoScroll` to `true` by double-clicking it.

This Firefox extension bases upon [Paste Onto New Tab Button](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/paste-onto-new-tab-button/) by [Marien Zwart](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/user/mzz/), which stopped working after [an API change in Firefox 25](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2013/09/30/compatibility-for-firefox-25/). Since the patch I proposed in an add-on review 2014 can no longer be easily applied with compulsory add-on signing and the contact information of the original author is out of date, I revived this add-on.
